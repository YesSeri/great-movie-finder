'The Witness' has become a cult classic, well received by critics and general audiences when it was finally released outside of Hungary. 'The Witness' takes place during the height of the Rákosi Era, which was closely modeled after the ruthless and brutal Stalin regime. The film follows the life of an ordinary dike keeper, József Pelikán, who has been caught for illegally slaughtering his pig, Dezsõ. Instead of doing hard time for his \"heinous\" crime, Pelikán is elevated into an important position, generally reserved for the communist elite. His new benefactor, the mysterious Comrade Virág, is reluctant to reveal the real reason behind Pelikán's preferential treatment. Thus, begins Pelikán's hilarious adventure deep within the \"sophisticated\" communist society... Until one day, when he gets called for to return the \"favour\" by falsely testifying against his long-time friend in a mock-up show trial.",

It won three National Film Awards that year; for Best Actor (Mohanlal), in the category of Special Jury for Raveendran's music, and Best Male Singer (K. J.
