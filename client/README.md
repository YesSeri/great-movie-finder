# Client for FOUNDAFILM

Here is all the code for the client of foundafilm.

## Things to figure out

- Make the site
  - Prio 1 is just to get a working, semi-good looking site out there, and then I can fix all the other things. 
- Find a good way to create a carousel.
  - Currently I am using react-responsive-carousel, but it only show one image at a time.
    - Add a thumbnail to it?
    - Switch to embla-carousel, and show several at a time. This needs a lot more configuring to be responsive.
